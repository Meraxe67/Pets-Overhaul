			FortuneInfo:
				'''
				All fortune stats increase the amount of items obtained in said category of items. (Ex. Ores = Mining Fortune)
				They work with 100% effectiveness for items gained by Pets of the same Class, and 50% for items gained through non-pet means.
				For example: If you have 100 Harvesting Fortune, gather 3 Dayblooms by hand and +2 with Magical Pumpkin Seed (Squashling Pet)
				This will result in 1.5 (item gained through non-pet means, 50% effective) + 2 (item gained through Pet perk, 100% effective) more Daybloom.
